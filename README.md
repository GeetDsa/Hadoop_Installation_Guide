HADOOP INSTALLATION GUIDE
====
###Please refer *Hadoop_installation.pdf* for installation guide.

I have also created the shell script (*install_hadoop.sh*) to perform all the steps from Step 1.6 onwards to Step 3.6 (Note: Except Step 2.1 & 2.2). You can execute the shell script to avoid excessive time consumption. But also ensure that the name of the hadoop file downloaded matches with the one in the script.

Steps to execute the script:
1. Save all the attachments in the "Home" directory.
2. Give the execute permission to the shell script (The one in .sh format)
3. Run the shell scrip as sh install\_hadoop.sh
